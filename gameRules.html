            <ol>
                <li><strong>Objective:</strong><br>
                    The objective of the game is to accumulate points by forming a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, while also outscoring the dealer. The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Game Setup:</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The game is played between a single player and the dealer.</li>
                        <li>Each player starts with a score of zero.</li>
                        <li>A standard 52-card deck is used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The player initiates the game by pressing the "Deal" button.</li>
                        <li>Upon dealing, the player receives a pair of cards facing up, and the dealer receives two cards facing down.</li>
                        <li>The player has the option to either "Hit" (receive an additional card) or "Stand" (keep the current cards) to improve their hand's value.</li>
                        <li>If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they go "Bust," and the round is automatically won by the dealer.</li>
                        <li>If the player's initial hand value equals 21, they achieve "Blackjack" and win the round automatically.</li>
                        <li>Once the player stands, the dealer reveals their facedown card.</li>
                        <li>The dealer must draw additional cards ("Hit") until their hand value is 17 or higher.</li>
                        <li>If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they go "Bust," and the player wins the round.</li>
                        <li>The round concludes when both the player and dealer stand.</li>
                        <li>The winner of the round is determined by comparing the hand values of the player and the dealer. The closest to 21 without exceeding it wins the round.</li>
                        <li>The winner of each round earns one point.</li>
                    </ul>
